# Campus Meets - http://campusmeets.herokuapp.com

This project was made for a hackathon that my buddies, Aaron Lobo, Hani Mir, Raj Joshi and I had competed in.

The idea behind this project was because as students, we noticed that we didnâ€™t have time to go meet with other students outside of our faculty, engineering, since our schedules were so hectic (sometimes 40+ hours of class a week). Due to this we made this project so that we could connect with other students around the school and potentially meet new people.

The purpose of Campus Meets was to allow students from different faculties to randomly be matched online by their likes/dislikes and then be able to talk to each other for a period of 2 days where they would then be matched with another student.

Login is done through Facebook accounts.

NOTE: This is not a dating website, this website was made for students to meet other students and could potentially lead them to become friends.
